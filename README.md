Simple Java Sampling Wrapper (SJSW) is a library that wraps the intristics of JVM profilers (the only one currently support is the async-profiler) and provides the implementation for building context call trees from profiler's JFR output that can be used for the analysis of performance or application's internal behavior.

## Research
This library was created as part of the implementation phase of the Computer Science Bachelor's Thesis: Examination of Performance Change Detection Efficiency Using Sampling and Instrumentation Techniques (Juozas Skarbalius, March 2025).
